first, we cin all of the data, the length, and the string. Then we can copy 
the string 3 times and then use the data. Use the string at the middle.
To use the string at the middle, use the length of one string, then get the index 2x.
cut the string at any place in the middle, and count up indexes or down
and get the letter in the starting index. then use a for loop and get all the starting points.
