CLASS NOTES:

if only one number is inserted into the queue, the front() and back()
are both the same.
Stack is first in first out basis. there are many functions:
empty() //self explanatory
pop()
front()//get the first value
push()//push a number to the end of queue
size()//amount of elements
there is no back in a queue

you have to include queue:
#include <queue>
